Personal Finance Tracking Program Pseudocode:

1. Make an extra module (finance_module.py).
	-This file has only one function, displayAmount, which formats regular numbers to look like money format.

2. Create the main program file and bring in the displayAmount from finance_module.py.

3. Set up the Finance1 class to store basic money details:
	-Budget, income, expenses, and savings.
	-Also, add a function to figure out how much extra money is left after expenses and savings.

4. Make another class, Finance2, which builds on Finance1:
	-This class has a function that creates a financial summary.
	-It makes sure all the numbers are neatly formatted using displayAmount.

5. Write a function to get user input:
	-Ask the user for their budget, income, expenses, and savings.
	-If they enter something weird (like text instead of a number), show an error.

6. Once the user enters their info:
	-Create a Finance2 object with those values.
	-Use it to generate a summary of their finances.

7. Save the summary to a text file (finance_tracker.txt):
	-Open the file and write everything down
	-Close the file when done

8. Make a simple user interface with Tkinter:
	-Add text boxes for budget, income, expenses, and savings.
	-Include a button called “Save and View Summary” to run the input function.

9. Run the UI and let the user try it out.
