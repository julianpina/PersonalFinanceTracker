Option 2: Personal Finance Tracking Program

This program is an introductory finance tracker that helps keep track of money. Itâ€™s very simple; all you have to do is enter your budget, income, expenses, and savings, and it tells you how much money you have left after everything. It works by asking you to enter your numbers in a basic interface; then, it does the calculations for you. After that, it shows a summary on the screen and saves it to a text file.
